# ML-Classifiers
A compilation of the various classifiers I used in learning ML. I found the general process is the same, but the only real variation in code would be in how the data is cleaned. I used classifiers for non-linearly separable data for a better sense of real world application.
All parameters were assumed since tuning methods such as k-fold validation and grid search were not known to me at the time. They will however appear in future projects.


Python - Language
Anaconda - Used for creating environments
Numpy, pandas, matplotlib - three main libraries used to execute code
